Notification is a managed tool for marketing in order to keep customers visiting and shopping at Tiki. Some examples of usage of this tool are to send coupons, reminders and recommendations for customers.
Currently, the Notification Team wants to divide all customers (who have already purchased at Tiki) into different segments in order to send them proper messages to the customer.

As a Data Analyst, letâ€™s help them to come up with a solution to segment all these customers, which should meet two requirements of Notification Team as bellow:
- Requirement 1: Segments must ensure the differences in purchase intention of customers (so Notification Team can send different messages with different incentive levels to them). The solution needs to prove the difference in purchase intention of the segments.
- Requirement 2: Segments need to be mutually exclusive (they are not overlapping with each other or another way to say, a customer must not exist in more than one group/segment). For example, Notification Teams can segment all customers by the last event of the user. (but this solution might or might not meet requirement 1).
